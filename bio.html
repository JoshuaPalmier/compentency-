    <!--  used article to structer my layout -->
    <article class=bio> 
      <p>I was born <em> October 10, 1991 </em>, in Birmingham, Alabama. His mother's name is Johanna Henson, and his father's name is Cedric palmer. He is the youngest of his siblings Cedrick, Ja'cia, and Keturah. I spent most of my life relocating to different states, so I didn't pick up many hobbies except playing video games. In August 2011, I attended school at Lawson State Community College before joining the military as a Transporation Management Coordinator on <em>September 10, 2012 </em>.</p>
      <br>
     <p>After Completing basic Training at Fort Jackson, SC, I was assigned to South Korea, where I meet my wife, Natasha. After Korea, I moved back to the states and was stationed at Fort Eustis VA, Fort Carson, CO, and Fort Campbell Ky. While serving at these duty stations, I deployed to Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Iran, Jordan, and Turkey as a Movement Specialist. After deploying many times, I decided to get out on Jan 31, 2020.</p>
      <br>
      <p>After the military, my wife and I moved to Colorado to raise our son Israel. I changed my career field to web development to spend as much time with my family and create a great source of income. After learning more about web development, I started to generate a severe passion for it. <strong> My goals </strong>  are to create my own Software Engineer Tutoring course, Start my own freelance business, and receive my bachelor's in data science.</p>
